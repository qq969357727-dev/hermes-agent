/**
 * Transcript — the scrolling message pane (spec v4 §2 `view/transcript.tsx`).
 *
 * ONE full-height <scrollbox> with a reactive <For> (opencode's model — the
 * viewport clips growing output so terminal scrollback is never corrupted; no
 * `writeToScrollback`). Carries the §8 #2 gotchas EXACTLY:
 *   - `minHeight:0` on BOTH the wrapper box AND the <scrollbox> (so the flex
 *     child can shrink below content height instead of pushing the composer off),
 *   - NO `flexDirection` on the <scrollbox> ROOT style (it has internal
 *     viewport/content children; setting it there breaks content-height
 *     measurement → phantom scroll offset that clips the top + leaves a gap),
 *   - `stickyScroll` + `stickyStart="bottom"` to pin the latest line.
 *
 * A `ScrollAnchorProvider` gives collapse/expand toggles (tool/thinking) a handle
 * to hold the viewport in place so expanding doesn't yank to the bottom (#4).
 *
 * ── Windowing (S1+S2 of docs/plans/opentui-transcript-windowing.md, #27) ───
 * Behind `HERMES_TUI_WINDOWING` (unset → ON; 0/false/no/off → OFF), each row is
 * wrapped in a measuring box (`onSizeChange` records its exact laid-out height,
 * margins included) and rows outside [scrollTop − viewport, scrollTop +
 * 2·viewport) swap to an EXACT-HEIGHT empty spacer `<box height={recorded}/>`
 * — 1 yoga node, no text buffers, no native handles — so the mounted set stays
 * ~3 viewports of rows regardless of transcript length (the 671MB→Ink-parity
 * memory fix). The Solid `<Show>` unmount destroys the row's renderables
 * (@opentui/solid `_removeNode` → `destroyRecursively()` once unparented).
 *
 * Drivers (S2 — append-time adjudication, not just scroll):
 *  - a renderer frame callback (`setFrameCallback` — scroll always triggers a
 *    render, so every scroll movement is observed; no extra timer) compares
 *    `scrollTop` AND `scrollHeight` to the last computation anchor with
 *    ≥ ¼-viewport hysteresis (logic/window.ts),
 *  - a `createComputed` on `messages.length` re-adjudicates SYNCHRONOUSLY on
 *    every append/splice — while pinned at the bottom the window is anchored
 *    to the cumulative content BOTTOM (`pinnedBottom`), so burst-appended rows
 *    are windowed out the moment they scroll past the margin instead of
 *    ballooning the mounted set until the next frame.
 * Both publish the mounted-key set through one signal + `createSelector`, so
 * only rows whose mounted-ness actually flipped re-render.
 *
 * Never windowed: streaming rows, the last row while a turn runs, and the
 * bottom BOTTOM_ALWAYS_MOUNTED rows (see its doc). Rows the window has never
 * adjudicated default to MOUNTED only when created within the bottom
 * BOTTOM_ALWAYS_MOUNTED of the transcript or streaming (live rows paint
 * instantly with zero added latency); a row created deep in a bulk snapshot
 * (resume `commitSnapshot`) starts as an ESTIMATE spacer — a resumed 2k
 * session mounts only the bottom window. While a mouse selection is being
 * DRAGGED the window FREEZES (no swaps — a swap would destroy highlighted
 * renderables out from under the native selection walk); once the drag
 * finishes, the persisting highlight only PINS the rows containing selected
 * renderables (highlight + later Ctrl+C copy stay exact) so a streaming turn
 * can't balloon the mounted set behind a lingering selection.
 *
 * Spacer corrections (S2, the zero-jank rule): when a remount/measure lands a
 * height different from what the spacer occupied, the wrapper's onSizeChange
 * fires DURING the layout traversal, before any cell is painted. If the view
 * is pinned to the bottom the scrollbox's own sticky re-pin (which runs in the
 * content's onSizeChange, i.e. BEFORE the row wrappers') has already
 * re-anchored — nothing to do. Otherwise, for a row fully ABOVE the viewport
 * (`correctionIsLegal`), scrollTop is compensated by the delta in the same
 * frame, so visible content never moves. Corrections intersecting the
 * viewport are forbidden and simply not applied (the swap itself is the
 * accepted "fixed by remount" path).
 *
 * Lazy exact-measure (S2, design §4 — the documented SIMPLE choice):
 * @opentui/core cannot lay out without parenting into the live tree, so there
 * is no true offscreen measurement. When idle (no appends, no scroll movement,
 * no running turn, no selection for HERMES_TUI_WINDOW_IDLE_MS ≈ 1s), a pulse
 * mounts a small batch (MEASURE_BATCH_ROWS) of never-measured rows nearest the
 * bottom window edge (`edgeMeasureBatch` — they're the next to be seen),
 * records exact heights, and the next recompute swaps them back to now-exact
 * spacers; corrections obey the jank rule above. Rows far from the window keep
 * their estimates until the march reaches them. Scrolling itself measures the
 * margin band as it always did.
 *
 * DEV stats: current/peak simultaneously-mounted rows (logic/window.ts
 * `windowRowStats`) — exposed on `globalThis.__hermesTuiWindowStats` when
 * HERMES_TUI_WINDOW_STATS is set, asserted bounded by the headless tests.
 *
 * Known S2 limits (documented, deferred): /compact·/details toggles and width
 * resizes leave out-of-window spacer heights stale until remount or the idle
 * march (resize invalidation is S3, design §5). A discrete scroll jump larger
 * than the margin in one frame remounts a mis-estimated row already inside
 * the viewport — the in-viewport correction is forbidden (jank rule), so that
 * single user-caused frame absorbs the estimate error (the design's accepted
 * "remounted for view" path).
